# Extra Work:

## Many products available
For this prototype, I structured the products on the product page via javascript by using a json that help information about each product and their names, prices, etc. 

This setup allows me to put onto the page as many products as I want. For this iteration I put in six seperate products because the description I received for Muddy Paws Adventure Gear during the paper prototype assignment specified that the company only had these six products.

## Shopping cart
Something else that I added was the functionality in the shopping cart in the products page. This was important to me because according to my design, the shopping cart is always available at the bottom of the products page. I accomplished this by simply using javascript to add whatever product was chosen to a div that was given a unique ID which I used as my shopping cart. If the div was empty, I also programmatically detected that it was and filled the div with 'empty cart' text. 

## filtering and sorting
Finally, I added filtering into my product page via javascript - users are able to sort the products by those for cats, dogs, or both.
