# Extra Work:

##  Interesting and useful JavaScript functionality
The site features a filtering function to see products specifically for cats, dogs, etc. 
This page also features an interesting shopping cart that not only allows for users to delete items they no longer want(as the assignment required) but also allows them to customize the color, size, and quantity of items already in the cart. 

## Product pages for all your products, including all feedback and shopping cart functionality
All the product pages are built out. Each item is customizable and able to be added into the cart and seen at checkout. 

## Carousel
Finally, there is a 'related items' section in the product detail overlay that features a carousel. The carousel moves from item to item automatically when the user first opens the overlay. However, if the user interacts with the carousel, then the automatic behaviour stops. For now, I only built out one carousel that is repeated in every product overlay. Next steps would include the items on this carousel changing for every product.
